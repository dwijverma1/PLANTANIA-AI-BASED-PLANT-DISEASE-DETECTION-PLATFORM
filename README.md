PLANTANIA – AI-BASED PLANT DISEASE DETECTION PLATFORM
PLATFORM: Streamlit (Python Web App) THEME: Agri-Tech and Sustainability
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Farmers often struggle to identify plant diseases accurately and in time, leading to significant crop loss and reduced agricultural productivity. Access to expert botanists or agronomists is limited, especially in rural regions. There is a pressing need for an accessible, real-time tool that can aid in the early detection and prevention of plant diseases.
SOLUTION
Plantania is a web-based AI application that allows farmers to upload images of infected plants and receive instant predictions of the disease, along with its symptoms and recommended preventive measures. Built using image recognition and machine learning, Plantania aims to democratize access to plant healthcare, enabling sustainable farming through early intervention and informed decision-making.
HOW AI TOOLS WERE USED JUDICIOUSLY AND INNOVATIVELY
•
Image Detection: Leveraged OpenCV for real-time image processing to detect and segment infected regions on plant leaves.
•
Machine Learning Models: Utilized TensorFlow to build and train deep learning models capable of classifying various plant diseases with high accuracy.
•
Web Integration: Used Streamlit to deploy a responsive, easy-to-use web application for farmers with minimal technical know-how.
TECH TOOLS USED
•
Programming Language: Python
•
AI and ML Frameworks: TensorFlow, OpenCV
•
Web Application Development: Streamlit
•
Future Enhancements: Integration of a botanist contact system and multi-species support.
